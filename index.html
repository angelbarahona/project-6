<h2> PS4 contrast</h2>
<p>Ps4 has more of an expensive side but on the bright side Both the PS4 and PS4 Pro have a distinct advantage with faster memory (8GB GDDR5) while microsoft went with (8GB DDR3)</p>

<p>The base PS4 GPU is able to handle more foliage in environments than the base Xbox One</p>

<p><strong>Still, PS4 is winning the exclusives war by a MILE.</strong> Between big hits such as:<ul>
    <li> Uncharted 4</li>
     <li>Marvel's Spider-Man</li>
     <li>Horizon: Zero Dawn</li>
     <li>God of War</li>
    </ul>
     The PS4's exclusive offerings include some of the biggest and highest-rated AAA titles of this generation</p>

 <p>Sony's PlayStation 4 does something the Xbox One does not: <em>virtual reality.</em> Sony's PlayStation VR headset is a unique aspect of the PlayStation 4.</p>

 <p>Thatâ€™s the main reason for our pick. The PS4 has the best games, and the PS4 Pro makes them look as stunning as possible</p>

<h2> Xbox contrast</h2>
<P>Microsoft's biggest selling point for the Xbox One over the PlayStation 4 is backward compatibility.</P>
extremely complex gamepads

<p>That being said:</p><ul>
<li>The Xbox One game library is massive and includes a rich history of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games.</li>

<li>In general, Microsoft's approach to gaming with Xbox is friendlier to gamers than Sony's with the PlayStation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Xbox One X has proven far better at using its extra horsepower to improve the visuals of all games on the platform, enhanced or not.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft gave us the better hardware in the Xbox One X</p>
